## About This Site

Hi! I’m Viviana, a book lover who enjoys getting lost in fictional worlds filled with strong characters, unforgettable stories, and a touch of magic (or drama). This little corner is dedicated to five authors whose books have stayed with me long after I turned the last page.

I hope you find something here that inspires your next read!
